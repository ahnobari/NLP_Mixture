      "\n",
      "### Step 1:  To find the determinant of the matrix $M_n$, we can use the given formula for the determinant of an $n \\times n$ matrix. The formula states that the determinant of an $n \\times n$ matrix with first row or first column $a_1$ $a_2$ $a_3$ $\\dots$ $a_n$ is equal to $a_1C_1 - a_2C_2 + a_3C_3 - \\dots + (-1)^{n+1}a_nC_n$, where $C_i$ is the determinant of the $(n - 1) \\times (n - 1)$ matrix formed by eliminating the row and column containing $a_i$.\n",
      "### Step 2:  In this case, the matrix $M_n$ has entries as follows: for $1 \\le i \\le n$, $m_{i,i} = 10$; for $1 \\le i \\le n - 1$, $m_{i+1,i} = m_{i,i+1} = 3$; all other entries in $M_n$ are zero.\n",
      "### Step 3:  We can start by finding the determinant of the matrix $M_n$ using the given formula. We have $M_n = \\left[ {\\begin{array}{cc} 10 & 3 & \\cdots & 3 & \\cdots & 3 \\\\ 3 & 10 & \\cdots & 3 & \\cdots & 3 \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ 3 & 3 & \\cdots & 10 & \\cdots & 3 \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ 3 & 3 & \\cdots & 3 & \\cdots & 10 \\\\ \\end{array} } \\right]$, where all other entries are zero.\n",
      "### Step 4:  Using the formula for the determinant of an $n \\times n$ matrix, we can expand the determinant along the first row. This gives us $10C_1 - 3C_2 + 3C_3 - \\dots + (-1)^{n+1}3C_n$, where $C_i$ is the determinant of the $(n - 1) \\times (n - 1)$ matrix formed by eliminating the row and column containing $a_i$.\n",
      "### Step 5:  We can simplify the expression for the determinant of $M_n$ by using the properties of determinants. We have $C_1 = C_2 = \\dots = C_n = 0$, so the expression reduces to $10C_1 - 3C_2 + 3C_3 - \\dots + (-1)^{n+1}3C_n = 10C_1 - 3C_2 + 3C_3 - \\dots + (-1)^{n+1}3C_n$.\n",
      "### Step 6:  We can further simplify the expression by using the fact that $C_1 = C_2 = \\dots = C_n = 0$. This gives us $10C_1 - 3C_2 + 3C_3 - \\dots + (-1)^{n+1}3C_n = 10(-1)^{n+1}C_n$.\n",
      "### Step 7:  Now, we can find the determinant of the matrix $M_n$ by substituting the expression for $C_n$ into the equation. We have $D_n = 10(-1)^{n+1}C_n$.\n",
      "### Step 8:  We can then find the value of $\\frac{1}{8D_n+1}$ by substituting the expression for $D_n$ into the equation. We have $\\frac{1}{8D_n+1} = \\frac{1}{8(10(-1)^{n+1}C_n)+1} = \\frac{1}{80(-1)^{n+1}C_n+1}$.\n",
      "### Step 9:  We can simplify the expression further by using the fact that $C_n = 0$ for all $n \\ge 2$. This gives us $\\frac{1}{8D_n+1} = \\frac{1}{80(-1)^{n+1} \\cdot 0 + 1} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1$ for all $n \\ge 2$.\n",
