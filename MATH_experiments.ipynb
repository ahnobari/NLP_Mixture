We need to find the value of $r$.\\n\\n## Step 2: Draw a diagram\\nDrawing a diagram will help us visualize the problem. Let's draw the circles and label their centers and radii.\\n\\n## Step 3: Identify the relationship between the radii\\nSince the circles are externally tangent to one another, the distance between the centers of two adjacent circles is the sum of their radii.\\n\\n## Step 4: Label the diagram\\nLet's label the centers of the circles as $O_1$, $O_2$, $O_3$, and $O_4$, and their respective radii as $r$, 2, 3, and $r$.\\n\\n## Step 5: Apply the Pythagorean theorem\\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance between the centers of two adjacent circles. Let's consider the triangle formed by the centers of the circles $O_1O_2$ and $O_3O_4$. The distance between $O_1O_2$ is $r + 2$, the distance between $O_3O_4$ is $r + 3$, and the distance between $O_1O_3$ is $r + 3$. Applying the Pythagorean theorem, we get $(r + 2)^2 + (r + 3)^2 = (r + 3)^2$.\\n\\n## Step 6: Simplify the equation\\nExpanding and simplifying the equation, we get $r^2 + 4r + 4 + r^2 + 6r + 9 = r^2 + 6r + 9$.
